# AB-Testing on E-commerce data
*Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB-Testing with SQL's Final assignment key-take-aways*

I used SQL to set up a basic AB testing system. 
The major goal was to apply hypothesis testing to prove or disprove a hypothesis about how customer behavior changed after implementing a (business) intervention such as sending a promotion e-mail, or displaying our e-commerce website in a different manner to a subgroup of customers. Queries were written using Mode.com and a report was made with their integrated report builder.
